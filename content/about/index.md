I'm an Austinite, but I left my hometown in 2019 to move to Lisbon, Portugal.

I'm a [Product Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samrhea/) at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), where I work on [products](https://teams.cloudflare.com/) that help solve security problems. Opinions here are my own.
