I’m probably busy right now using a spreadsheet for a hobby project that doesn’t need one. Or walking a dog we named after the Austin's second-worst highway.

I'm an Austinite, but I left my hometown for Lisbon, Portugal. Product at Cloudflare, where I work on products that help solve security problems. Opinions here are my own.
